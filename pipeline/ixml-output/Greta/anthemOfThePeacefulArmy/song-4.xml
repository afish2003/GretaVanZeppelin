Ebm                  B
I  had a friend many years ago
    Gb              F5
One tragic night he died
Ebm                B
   The saddest time of my life
Gb
  For weeks and weeks I cried
F5 Ebm                      B
      Through the anger and through the tears
Gb                     F5
  I've felt his spirit through the years
Ebm                B
   I'd swear, He's watching me
Gb                           F5
Guiding me through hard times

Ebm  B
   I feel it once again
Gb     F5           Ebm
  It's overwhelming me 
    B
His spirit's like the wind
Gb F5                 Ebm
   The angel guarding me 
      B           Gb
Oh, I know, oh, I know
     F5            Ebm
He's watching over me 
      B           Gb
Oh, I know, oh, I know
     F5            Ebm
He's watching over me

Ebm                      B
We shared dreams like all best friends
Gb                      F5
  Blood brothers at the age of ten
Ebm                     B
   We lived reckless, he paid the price
Gb              F5
Why? Why did he have to die?
Ebm                    B
   It still hurts me to this day
Gb                 F5
  Am I selfish for feeling this way?
Ebm               B
   I know he's an angel now
  Gb                     F5
Together we'll be someday
