[Verse 1]
E           B    D    A             E
 Let the new day shine its light on me
E             B     D     A               E
 Shake the old way, nights too dark to see
E          B           D     A               E
 Free tomorrow, itâs bright with something new
E                B      D  A             E
 Believe the righteous, and it will come true
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
B                A          E
 Youâre a child in the garden
B                   F#m                 A    E
 Youâre growing up   Iâll watch you bloom
B               A              E
 And your dreams are not forgotten
B              F#m       A B
 Youâll be a woman soon
 
 
[Chorus]
E                 B         A             B
Love isnât greed itâs a need that goes unspoken
E               B              A        B
 Love doesnât leave when you fade away
E             B          A                   B
 Pain isnât vain if it means your heartâs been broken
E            B         A            B
 Pain is the same as a means to heal

[Verse 2]
E          B          D   A           E
 Let me try love, you know Iâm only one
E           B        D    A             E
 Live or die love, I tried and to me won
E              B            D   A          E
 Weâre the future, itâs hard to say we know
E          B       D   A              E
 And the suture is what we have to sew
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
B                A          E
 Youâre a child in the garden
B                   F#m                 A    E
 Youâre growing up   Iâll watch you bloom
B               A              E
 And your dreams are not forgotten
B              F#m       A B
 Youâll be a woman soon

[Chorus]
E                 B         A             B
Love isnât greed itâs a need that goes unspoken
E               B              A        B
 Love doesnât leave when you fade away
E             B          A                   B
 Pain isnât vain if it means your heartâs been broken
E            B         A            B
 Pain is the same as a means to heal

   Ah       Doesnât fade away
