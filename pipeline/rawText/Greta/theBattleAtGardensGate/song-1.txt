[Verse 1]
C         G         F
Sorrows of the Earth
        C            G          F
May our tears of rain wash down to bathe you
C                G        F         C               G         F
This is what life is worth When the fires still burn and rage all around
Am          G          Em  F
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Am             G     Em    F     F
Fire still burning on  the ground
 
 
[Verse 2]
C              G         F        C           G         F
Follow the fearsome sound As they march to battle, hear the drums pound
C              G       F       C             G         F
We do not fight for war But to save the lives of those who do so
Am          G          Em  F
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Am             G     Em    F     F
Fire still burning on  the ground
 
 
[Chorus]
C                    F
Can you feel my love?
G C                    F
  Rising with the heat above
G C                  F
  Life's the story of
G  C                    F
 Ascending to the stars as one
G C G F Am G Em F
 
 
[Verse 3]
C              G        F     C          G      F
Marching across the land Is a peaceful army joining the band
C           G       F
Walking hand in hand
      C          G       F
To an anthem loudly sung where they stand
Am          G          Em  F
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Am             G     Em    F     F
Fire still burning on  the ground

 Ascending to the stars as one
