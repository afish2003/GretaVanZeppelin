Anthem of the Peaceful Army
Greta Van Fleet

[Intro]
D G
 
 
[Verse 1]
D G    D                       G
   The sun shines brighter from above
    D                G
And you're the woman that I love
D                   G
Climb the mountain even higher
   D                G
To kiss the sun and fight the fire
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F  G A
 Oh   well
 
 
[Chorus]
D                  A G
 I'll make you mine
D                  A G
 You're my sunshine
D                  A G
 I'll make you mine
D                  A G D
 You're my sunshine
 
 
[Verse 2]
D                    G
Take me with you when you go
   D                 G
To be with you is all I know
D                   G
As we ride, we light the fire
    D                G
The second sun's our love's desire
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F  G A
 Oh  well
 
 
[Chorus]
D                  A G
 I'll make you mine
D                  A G
 You're my sunshine
D                  A G
 I'll make you mine
D                  A G
 You're my sunshine
