The Falling Sky
Starcatcher
Greta Van Fleet

[Intro]
D5
 
 
[Verse 1]
D5
  Iâve been handed a quite demanding and hardly standing lie to tell
Life is sorted and never thwarted itâs just supported by being well
Dm/F C/E                  Dm/F  C/E  G
        I donât want to loose this time
Bb                   C      Dm
  I just want to let it pass
 
 
[Chorus]
Dm  C  Bb
  Oh Oh  Oh
G
Holding up the falling sky
Dm  C  Bb
  Oh Oh  Oh
G
Holding up the falling sky
 
 
[Verse 2]
D5
  Hereâs the trouble with seeing double itâs torn down rubble thatâs left behind
You can live with a pointless forte that silly board game that you would know
Dm/F C/E                  Dm/F  C/E  G
        I donât want to loose this time
Bb                   C      Dm
  I just want to let it pass
 
 
[Chorus]
Dm  C  Bb
  Oh Oh  Oh
G
Holding up the falling sky
Dm  C  Bb
  Oh Oh  Oh
G
Holding up the falling sky
