# GrettaVanZeppelin
This project origionated for a semester project for DIGIT 210 at Penn State Behrend

## Basic Overview:
Gretta Van Fleet is a new-ish artist (2012) so not much research has been done on them, so an archival and research project based on their work is something that very much needs to be done. Also the media and pres commonly compare Gretta Van Fleet to Led Zeppelin especialy commenting on similarities in their writing style and stage presence. This project will progress as follows: We will first conduct research on Gretta Van Fleet and Led Zeppelin and then do a compare and contrast of their writing style via resources such as chord progressions and word choice.

## Resource Processing
Resource processing will mostly consist of processing chord sheets and lyrics, we will use XML markup with the lyrics to indicate where the chords fall.  We also plan to use some other processing, such as TEI or MEI, to go through and compose some digital interactive art to further represent the pieces from both artists. Our overall analyze will be centralized on searching for regular patterns across their songs and/or the chord progressions they choose.
Here is the music encoding website we will be using: https://music-encoding.org

## Final Implementation
We plan to implement and share our research via a interactive github pages site. We will use resources such as midi integrations to add interactivity and help to explain the chord progressions we observe through the songs. If we have extra time we may also compose some procedural node based art in MaxMSP to create abstract but data packed visuals to compare the artists.

This project is being worked on by Alexander Fisher, Michael Simons, Ashlynn Allgeier, and Connor Carpenter.
