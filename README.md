# GretaVanZeppelin Analysis
Semester project for (DIGIT 210)[https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub] at (Penn State Behrend)[https://behrend.psu.edu/]

## Basic Overview
(Greta Van Fleet)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Fleet] is a new-ish artist (c. 2012), so not much research has been done on them. An archival and research project based on their work is something that could prove to be very insightful. The press commonly compare Greta Van Fleet to (Led Zeppelin)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin], specifically commenting on similarities in their writing styles and stage presence. 

This project hopes to compare and contrast of their writing styles via aspects such as chord progressions and word choice.

## Resource Processing
Resource processing will mostly consist of chord sheets with lyrics. XML markup will indicate where the chords line up with the lyrics. We also plan to use some other Python-based NLP to compose digital interactive art to further represent the work of both artists. Our overall analysis will be focused on searching for regular patterns across their songs and/or the chord progressions they chose.

We will be using (**MEI**)[https://music-encoding.org] to encode the documents.

## Final Implementation
We plan to implement and share our research via an (interactive GitHub pages site)[https://afish2003.github.io/GretaVanZeppelin/]. We also may use resources such as MIDI files to add interactivity and explain the chord progressions of the songs. If we have ample time, we may also compose some procedural node based art in (MaxMSP)[https://cycling74.com/products/max] to create abstract but data packed visuals to compare the artists.

This project is being worked on by Alexander Fisher, Michael Simons, Ashlynn Allgeier, and Connor Carpenter.
