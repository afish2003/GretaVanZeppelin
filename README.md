# GrettaVanZeppelin
This project origionated for a semester project for DIGIT 210 at Penn State Behrend

## Basic Overview:
Gretta Van Fleet is a new-ish artist (2012) so not much research has been done on them. They are commonly compared to Led Zeppelin for their writing style and stage presence. It could be very cool to do research on Gretta Van Fleet and Led Zeppelin and then do a compare and contrast of their writing style with chord progressions and what types of words they use.

## Resource Processing
We will go through the chord sheets and markup the songs sections with their respective chords. We can then go through and do some digital interactive art to further represent the pieces from both artists. We can also analyze to see if there's regular patterns across their songs and the chord progressions they choose. 

## Final Implementation
We can also possibly do a website with some interactivity to explain the chord progressions we observe through the songs. I have some software on order also that will let me create some cool graphics that can interact with songs.
