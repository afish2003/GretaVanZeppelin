            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <pre>
Dm         C     Dm          C
We used to say that come the day
     Am            G
We'd all be making songs
Bb         F
Or finding better words
Bb          F            C
These ideas never lasted long

Dm           C   Dm         C
The way is up along the road
    Am             G
The air is growing thin
Bb       F
Too many friends who tried
Bb             F                 C
Blown off this mountain with the wind
      </pre>

            <pre>
C                              Gm
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
Bb      F                          C
When my time is up I'll see all my friends
C                              Gm
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
Bb            F               C
If you really mean it, it all comes round again
      </pre>
            
            <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <pre>
Dm       C    Dm      C
Now I see I'm all alone
Am              G
That's the only way to be
Bb               F
You'll have your chance again
Bb           F               C
Then you can do the work for me
      </pre>

Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge

If you really mean it, it all comes round again
