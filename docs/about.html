I ended up switching and now I am a DIGIT major! I love working on anything visual, from design to animation to photography. I am also working on starting up my own photography business, <a href="https://www.ashlynnallgeierphotography.com/">Ashlynn Allgeier Photography</a>. Outside of school and work, you’ll usually find me with a camera in hand, hanging out with animals, or diving into a creative project. I also volunteer on the worship team as a vocalist at <a href="htpps://www.facerie.org">First Alliance Church</a>. Whether I’m behind the camera or behind a mic, I love finding ways to share stories and connect with others.</li>

I grew up in Erie, PA, and most of my family lives here. Other than spending time with them, my main hobby is music. I'm in a local band, <a href="https://www.theband814.com">The Band 814</a>, and I work part-time in the music ministry at my church, <a href="https://www.facerie.org/">First Alliance Church</a>. </li>

                            decided to attend Behrend because it's close to home, and a lot of my
                            family has gone here. I chose to be a DIGIT major because I've always
                            enjoyed working with computers and technology in general, and also like
                            to express my creativity. In my free time, I enjoy working out,
                            listening to music, playing basketball, spending time with my friends
                            and family, and playing games with my friends.</li>
