She is a lady, comes from all around
A                            D
She's many places, but she's homeward bound
            A
And now she walks kinda funny
I think she knows
D
Day by day by day
Our love grows
A                   D
She's a lantern in the night
She's outta sight

Electric gold our love with tender care
A                     D
Hills of satin grass and maidens fair
        A
Now she rides through the night
On a silver storm

Sword in hand
Our fate's torn

She's a sparrow of the dawn
Our love is born
